======================================

![](jshint-blue.png)


[JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/about/) is a popular, community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code.  This project integrates JSHint into the Eclipse IDE.  It automatically validates \*.js files and adds warning markers for every problem found by JSHint.
